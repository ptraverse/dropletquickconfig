Quick Shell file to do setup and installation of 

* vim 
* gitconfig
* npm + yarn
* mongo + mysql

Note that `source ~/.bashrc` is still required at the end to get the PS1 to look good

But the whole thing can be done in a single liner with:

`curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ptraverse/dropletquickconfig/master/master.sh | bash `
